Now please write a suitable title and summary for the book and each chapter in the following JSON format.
The book summary should not only provide an overview but also mention the primary objectives, scope, and depth of the content, in about 5-8 detailed sentences withing single paragraph.
Each chapter summary should also contain about 2 to 3 detail sentences.
Please also consider the page allocation for each chapter in units of 0.1, like 0.8 pages.
Additionally, consider whether each chapter needs further division based on semantic cohesion (needsSubdivision), and answer true or false.
Do not include any speculative or unverified information. Please avoid writing chapter numbers in the titles.
The number of sections should vary as needed. 
Please do not include any extra introductory or conclusory message outside the expected json format.

To help you, I am also providing you the summary of the book as follows:
{book_summary}

As part of that, your current task is to create content across {n_pages} pages, assuming {n_lines_per_page} lines per page for the chapter or section, "{target}" of the book.
The summary for the section is as follows:
{section_summary}

Your task also is to divide this chapter into multiple parts and output the titles and summaries of each part in the following JSON format.
Also, consider the page allocation for each part in units of 0.1, like 0.8, 2.0 etc. pages. Combined page unit should ad upto total page.
Additionally, consider whether each part needs further division based on semantic cohesion (needsSubdivision) and answer true or false.
Please avoid including section numbers in the titles. 
Please do not include any extra introductory or conclusory message outside the expected format.
Enclose the json content between ```json and ``` delimiters.

The output format should be strictly as follows:

# Prompt for Generating Main Content
prompt_content_creation = prompt_common + """

As part of that, now, you as a LeTex expert writing the book with the title "{book_title}" and the summary of the book is as follows:
{book_summary}

{toc_and_summary}
{previous_sections}. 

Now, I would like you to create TeX content for the current section on: {target}, across {n_pages} pages, assuming {n_lines_per_page} lines per page. 
The summary for the current section whose content you will generate is as follows: {section_summary}. Please generate the tex content.

Please output the content in the following format:
- Enclose the LaTeX content strictly between the delimiters `<|tex_start|>` and `<|tex_end|>`, as shown below:
    - The LaTeX output **must start with** `<|tex_start|>` delimiter.
    - The LaTeX output **must end with** `<|tex_end|>` delimiter.
- Do not include any other explanations, comments outside these delimiters.
- Do not return markdown tags instead return Latex tags where necessary. 
    For example, instead of `# `, `## `, `### ` return \section{{""}}, \subsection{{""}}, \subsubsection{{""}} tags of LateX as requied. Also same for itemize items.
- Carefully, escape special characters `&` as `\&` to ensure valid LaTeX.
- Do not include backtick sequences or any unrelated formatting not part of LaTeX syntax.
- The LaTeX snippet should be formatted as part of a book section and include proper LaTeX syntax for \section{{""}}, \subsection{{""}}, \subsubsection{{""}}, mathematical equations (if necessary), lists, and text formatting. 
- The number of sections or subsection should be 2-3 per page. But paragraph should be long and elaborative.
- Use balanced and valid LaTeX tags (e.g., properly closed brackets, environments, and commands).
- Avoid non-standard Unicode symbols that may break LaTeX compilation. Use only standard LaTeX symbols.
- Replace special characters with their LaTeX-safe equivalents (e.g., replace & with \&, % with \%, etc.).
- Do not include document class, preamble, or any unnecessary elements. Focus only on content.
- Use the `<|tex_start|>` and `<|tex_end|>` delimiters **only once** in the output response: at the beginning and at the end of the response respectively.

After generating the tex content, please check if the tex is compilable with pdflatex compiler or not. If fails, modify the tex output so that it does not break.

Final output format:
    <|tex_start|>
    tex response
    <|tex_end|>
