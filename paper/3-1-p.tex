\section{Linear Transformations}

A linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is a function that satisfies the following two properties:
- Linearity: $T(a \mathbf{x}) = a T(\mathbf{x})$ for all $\mathbf{x}$ and all scalars $a$
- Invertibility: $T$ has an inverse transformation $T^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$

The matrix representation of $T$ is given by:
$$
[T]_{\mathcal{B}} = [T(\mathbf{e}_i)]_{i=1}^{n}
$$

where $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^m$. The transformation $T$ can also be represented as:
$$
[T \mathbf{x}]_{\mathcal{B}} = [c_i]_{i=1}^{n}
$$

for some scalars $c_i$. In this case, the matrix representation is given by:

$$
[T]_{\mathcal{B}} = [T(\mathbf{e}_i)]_{i=1}^{n}
$$

A linear transformation can be represented as a matrix equation:
$T \mathbf{x} = A \mathbf{x}$

where $A$ is the matrix representation of $T$. The inverse of $T$ can also be represented by the inverse of $A$.

The transformation $T$ can also be represented using change of basis matrices:
$$
[T]_{\mathcal{B}} = [U]^{-1} [T(\mathbf{e}_i)] [V]
$$

where $U$ and $V$ are change of basis matrices. 

$$
[T \mathbf{x}]_{\mathcal{B}} = [c_i]_{i=1}^{n}
$$

This equation is equivalent to:

$$
[T \mathbf{x}]_{\mathcal{A}} = A^{-1} [T(\mathbf{e}_i)] [x]_{\mathcal{A}}
$$

where $A$ is the matrix representation of $T$, $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ are bases for $\mathbb{R}^m$. 

The transformation can also be represented in the form:
$$
[T \mathbf{x}]_{\mathcal{B}} = [c_i]_{i=1}^{n}
$$

Using the change of basis formula, we have:

$$
[T \mathbf{x}]_{\mathcal{A}} = A^{-1} [T(\mathbf{e}_i)] [x]_{\mathcal{A}}
$$
