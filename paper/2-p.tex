\section{Linear Transformations}

A linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is a function that satisfies the following two properties:
- Linearity: $T(a \mathbf{x}) = a T(\mathbf{x})$ for all $\mathbf{x}$ and all scalars $a$
- Invertibility: $T$ has an inverse transformation $T^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$

The matrix representation of $T$ is given by:
$$
[T]_{\mathcal{B}} = [T(\mathbf{e}_i)]_{i=1}^{n}
$$

where $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^m$. The transformation $T$ can also be represented as:
$$
[T \mathbf{x}]_{\mathcal{B}} = [c_i]_{i=1}^{n}
$$

for some scalars $c_i$. In this case, the matrix representation is given by:
$$
[T]_{\mathcal{B}} = [T(\mathbf{e}_i)]_{i=1}^{n}
$$
