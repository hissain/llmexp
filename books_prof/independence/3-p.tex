\ chapter{The Role of the Indian National Congress}

The Indian National Congress played a pivotal role in Bangladesh's struggle for independence. The party's involvement was multifaceted, impacting both politics and society.

During its existence in British India, the Indian National Congress had long been involved in discussions regarding self-rule for Indians. As such, many of its supporters saw it as a champion of indigenous rights.

In particular, the Indian National Congress lent its support to the All-India Muslim League's demand for Pakistan. This backing significantly contributed to the creation of Pakistan and later, Bangladesh.

Moreover, the party held several meetings with British officials in an effort to secure greater autonomy for Bengal. Although none of these negotiations resulted in favorable outcomes for Bengal, they did serve as a precursor to future discussions regarding regional autonomy.

Furthermore, the Indian National Congress's support for Bengali nationalism increased after the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan. This backing played a significant role in galvanizing the movement seeking independence from British rule and ultimately the creation of Bangladesh.

The party also fostered closer ties between its leaders and key figures in the Bengali nationalist movement. For example, Liaquat Ali Khan, then Prime Minister of Pakistan, frequently exchanged letters with Chittaranjan Das, a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress's Bengal chapter.

In addition to its political influence, the Indian National Congress also contributed significantly to social change by supporting various organizations that promoted education and cultural exchange between Hindus and Muslims.

Overall, the role of the Indian National Congress in Bangladesh's struggle for independence cannot be overstated. Its involvement helped shape both the country's politics and society, paving the way for the eventual creation of an independent nation.
