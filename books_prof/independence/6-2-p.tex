\chapter{Mujib's Leadership and the Formation of Awami League}

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's leadership played a pivotal role in galvanizing opposition to Pakistan's military regime, leading to the formation of the Awami League as a united front against government repression.

The Awami League was formed in 1948 by Rahman with the goal of uniting Bengali-speaking people from both East and West Pakistan. Over time, the league grew into a powerful force for Bengali nationalism.

In 1966, Rahman became the leader of the Awami League after A.K. Fazlul Huq's death. He used his leadership skills to mobilize opposition to the Pakistani government.

Rahman also led a mass movement against Pakistani atrocities in East Pakistan, which eventually culminated in the Bangladesh Liberation War.
