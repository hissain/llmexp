\chapter{The 6 November 1971 Attack}

On 6 November 1971, Pakistani forces launched a surprise attack on the Bengali Army's headquarters in Dacca, marking the beginning of full-scale conflict between the two sides. The attack was carried out by the Pakistan Army Air Force (PAAF) and was designed to capture key targets and disrupt the Bangladeshi army's command structure.

The PAAF launched a series of airstrikes on Bengali military installations, including airfields, barracks, and communication centers. The attacks were supported by ground troops, who advanced on Dacca from all directions.

The Bangladeshi army put up fierce resistance, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. Despite this, the army managed to hold off the Pakistani forces for several days, buying time for reinforcements to arrive from India.

The 6 November 1971 attack was a turning point in the Bangladesh Liberation War, marking the transition from a guerrilla conflict to a full-scale war between the two sides. It also marked the beginning of India's direct involvement in the conflict, which would ultimately prove decisive in determining the outcome of the war.

In the years following the attack, Pakistan would launch a series of brutal attacks on Bengali civilians and military personnel, leading to widespread human rights abuses and atrocities. The legacy of these events continues to shape international relations between India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to this day.

As the situation in Dacca deteriorated, Indian troops began to arrive in large numbers, marking the beginning of India's direct involvement in the conflict. Over the coming days, Indian forces would launch a series of major attacks against Pakistani positions, ultimately leading to the capture of Dhaka on 16 December 1971.
