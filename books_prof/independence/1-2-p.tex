The cultural heritage of Bangladesh is rich and diverse, spanning thousands of years. The ancient civilizations of Bengal, including the Mauryan Empire and the Gupta Empire, left an indelible mark on the region's culture.

Islamic influence also played a significant role in shaping Bangladeshi culture. The arrival of Islam in the 12th century CE brought new customs, traditions, and architectural styles to the region.

Traditional customs such as the marriage ceremony, known as "mohajot", and the festival of "Pohela Boishakh" are still observed today. The traditional dress of Bangladesh, known as "shari", is also an important part of the country's cultural heritage.

The Bengali language, which is spoken by over 100 million people, has a rich literary tradition that dates back to the 12th century CE. Famous poets such as Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam have made significant contributions to Bangladeshi literature.
