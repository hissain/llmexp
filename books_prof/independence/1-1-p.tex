Bangladesh is a country located in South Asia, bordered by India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. The country has a total area of approximately 147,570 square kilometers (56,977 square miles), making it one of the smaller countries in the region.

The geographical boundaries of Bangladesh can be divided into three main regions: the deltaic plain, the hilly tract, and the Chittagong Hill Tract. The deltaic plain is the most densely populated region of the country, covering about 95\% of its land area. It is characterized by vast expanses of rivers, wetlands, and fertile soil.

The hilly tract is located in the northeastern part of the country, covering an area of approximately 10\% of Bangladesh's total territory. The Chittagong Hill Tract is a separate region located in the southeastern part of the country, comprising seven ethnic groups and a diverse array of flora and fauna.

Bangladesh's natural resources are rich in water, fertile soil, and minerals. The country has an extensive coastline along the Bay of Bengal, with over 700 kilometers (435 miles) of shoreline. Its rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna, support agriculture, industry, and urban centers.

The country's geographical location and boundaries have played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The strategic position of Bangladesh at the crossroads of Asia has made it an important center for trade, commerce, and cultural exchange.
